    <h3>World Hunger announcement </h3>
     <p> My next and last animation comes from what witnessed in Nigeria when I went
     and my overall concern about world hunger. I seen people hunger and suffering
   from malnutrition and its always hard to see. We deserve to have food we can
 eat that will satisfy our needs to survive. So, I made this animation to
  bring awareness to the problem and to helpfully encourage people to help
the hungery anyway they can. </p>
