    <h2>Steven's birthday</h2>
    <p> This animation consist of a birthday celebration with a man named Steven
    with his son. This relates to me because my father and I went to Nigeria
  during the winter and he birthday was around that time. Even though more of
my cousins were there, it felt like it was me and my dad since I didn't know
my cousins too well.This is because it was my first time in Nigeria. </p>
